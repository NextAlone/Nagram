## Compilation Guide

**NOTE: Building on Windows is, unfortunately, not supported.
Consider using a Linux VM or dual booting.**

**Important:**

0. Checkout all submodules
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

1. Install Android SDK and NDK (default location is $HOME/Android/SDK, otherwise you need to specify $ANDROID_HOME for it)

It is recommended to use [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to install.

2. Install golang ( 1.16 ).
```shell
# debian sid
apt install -y golang-1.16
```

3. Install Rust and its stdlib for Android ABIs, and add environment variables for it.

It is recommended to use the official script, otherwise you may not find rustup.

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- --default-toolchain none -y
echo "source \$HOME/.cargo/env" >> $HOME/.bashrc && source $HOME/.cargo/env

rustup install $(cat ss-rust/src/main/rust/shadowsocks-rust/rust-toolchain)
rustup default $(cat ss-rust/src/main/rust/shadowsocks-rust/rust-toolchain)
rustup target install armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

This step can be skipped if you want to build a `mini` release.

4. Build native dependencies: `./run init libs`
5. Build external libraries and native code: 

For full release:

`./run libs update`

For mini release:
```
./run libs v2ray
./run libs native # libtmessages.so
```
 
9. Fill out `TELEGRAM_APP_ID` and `TELEGRAM_APP_HASH` in `local.properties`
10. Replace TMessagesProj/google-services.json if you want fcm to work.
11. Replace release.keystore with yours and fill out `ALIAS_NAME`, `KEYSTORE_PASS` and `ALIAS_PASS` in `local.properties` if you want a custom sign key.

`./gradlew assemble<Full/Mini><Debug/Release/ReleaseNoGcm>`

## FAQ

#### What is the differences between NekoX and Nekogram?

Developed by different developers, read the feature list above to understand the differences.

#### What is the difference between the Full and Mini version?

The full version comes with built-in proxy support for v2ray, shadowsocks, shadowsocksr, and trojan, which is usually provided to advanced users to help friends who have no computer knowledge in mainland China to bypass censorship. Don't complain about imperfect functions or ask to add other rare proxy types, you can use their clients directly.

#### What if I don't need a proxy?

Then it is recommended to use the `Mini` version.

#### What is the noGcm version?

Google Cloud Messaging, also known as gcm / fcm, message push service by google used by original Telegram android app, it requires your device to have Google Service Framework (non-free) installed.

#### I've encountered a bug!

First, make sure you have the latest version installed (check the channel, Play store versions usually have a delay).

Then, if the issue appears in the official Telegram client too, please submit it to the officials, (be careful not to show NekoX in the description and screenshots, the official developers doesn't like us!).

Then, please *detail* your issue, create an issue or submit it to our [group](https://t.me/NekoXChat) with #bug.

If you experience a *crash*, you also need to click on the version number at the bottom of the settings and select "Enable Log" and send it to us.

## Localization

Is NekoX not in your language, or the translation is incorrect or incomplete? Get involved in the translations on our [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/nekox/).

### Adding a new language

First and foremost, Android must already support the specific language and locale you want to add. We cannot work with languages that Android and the SDK do not support, the tools simply break down. Next, if you are considering adding a country-specific variant of a language (e.g. de-AT), first make sure that the main language is well maintained (e.g. de). Your contribution might be useful to more people if you contribute to the existing version of your language rather than the country-specific variant.

Anyone can create a new language via Weblate.

### Adding unofficial translations for Telegram

Current built-in language packs:

* 简体中文: [moecn](https://translations.telegram.org/moecn)
* 正體中文: [taiwan](https://translations.telegram.org/taiwan)
* 日本語: [ja_raw](https://translations.telegram.org/ja_raw)

You can [open an issue to](https://github.com/NekoX-Dev/NekoX/issues/new?&template=language_request.md) request to amend the built-in translation.
